# Portfolio-Pieces
## Welcome to my repository!

Hello! My name is Monica and I'm a technical writer who currently works creating product documentation. I created this repository so that I have a central location to host my portfolio pieces that I create. 

I currently have a couple of pieces uploaded on my [personal website](https://monicathetechwriter.com/portfolio/); however, in my quest to become more technical, I decided it was time to dive into the world of Git. My goals for this space/joining Github are:

-Learn Git and get some hands on experience with it
-Create more projects to host here
-Contribute documentation to open source projects

Thanks for reading!
